# House-Price-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict California housing prices based on various socio-economic and geographical features. Leveraging Python and libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn, it implements a Linear Regression model to make predictions based on historical data from the California housing dataset.

## Project Workflow

1. **Load Data**: Import the California housing dataset.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
3. **Explore Data**: Visualize relationships and correlations in the data.
4. **Split Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. **Train Model**: Train a Linear Regression model on the training data.
6. **Evaluate Model**: Assess the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
7. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict housing prices on new data.

 ## Libraries Used

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: Data visualization
- **scipy.stats** and **statsmodels.api**: Statistical analysis and OLS assumptions check
- **sklearn.linear_model (LinearRegression)**: Linear Regression model implementation
- **sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split)**: Splits data into training and test sets
